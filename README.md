# Repo Builder 

Simplify the process of adding recommended key files to your GitHub repo, specializing in Python repos, by calling foundation.py with a single argument: the folder of your new Git repo-- or one you want to apply some polish to.

Foundation will provide you the following files:
* [ ] Data folder
* [ ] Tests folder
* [ ] Src folder containing a setup_logging.py template
* [ ] Docs folder
* [ ] Starter .gitignore
* [ ] ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md
* [ ] AUTHORS.md [initialized with the owner of the repo by first commit]
* [ ] CODEOWNERS
* [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md [initialized with a default code of conduct from GitHub]
* [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
* [ ] License starter file: MIT License
* [ ] Readme template, including a checklist of how to finalize your repo
* [ ] Example git aliases
* [ ] pyproject.toml starter file
* [ ] requirements.txt starter file containing: uv, ruff, pytest, coverage

In addition to that functionality, the readme you are reading comes equipped with some online software engineering tools.  
Please remember security and safety when posting information into any of these tools.  When in doubt, find a non-online solution behind your firewall.

This could be a GitHub template repo, except for some automation under the hood.

I recommend these for a software engineering starter kit, suitable for "Raindrop.io," "Pocket," "Evernote," or "Google Keep".
