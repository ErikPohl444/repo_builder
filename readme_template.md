## Repo checklist

Repo checklist:

* [ ] Run foundation.py with the destination project folder as a command line argument.
    * This will copy all important files to your project, renaming at least one for your repo.
    * Don't worry.  It won't overwrite existing files with the same names there.
* [ ] Complete .gitignore
    * [ ] Keep the starter .gitignore and add to it.
    * [ ] OR delete the starter I'm providing and either create one via template in GitHub by typing in the name .gitignore in the file name after choosing to create a file
    * [ ] OR create one using https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/
* [ ] Follow AUTHORS_instructions to populate AUTHORS.md.
    * Foundation will populate the first commit author if it can find a git repo and at least one commit.
    * Refer to [these instructions](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/releasing/authors) for other ways to create and maintain this reference. 
* [ ] Add a sponsor button, if interested: [sponsor button](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository)
* [ ] Add a social media image, if interested: [social media image](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview)
* [ ] Add topics to your repo: [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)
* [ ] Enter any acknowledgements into ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md.
* [ ] Accept a license:
    * The default license provided by this process is the MIT License.
    * If you don't want that one, delete it from your repo and use GitHub to [select one easily](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository).
* [ ] Accept a code of conduct:
    * Delete the current CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md if you don't want the recommended code of conduct.
    * If you prefer another code of conduct, you can make your own or use GitHub's [easy instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project).
* [ ] Accept a CODEOWNERS file.
    * Blank is fine to start out with.
    * Use [these instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) from Github if you'd like to develop CODEOWNERS more.
* [ ] Modify CONTRIBUTING.md, if you want [instructions for contributing](https://contributing.md/how-to-build-contributing-md/).
* [ ] Add a [CITATIONS.cff file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) if you'd like to specify how others cite your work.
* [ ] Update README.md
* [ ] If you need a Makefile, [make one](https://makefiletutorial.com/)
* [ ] If you need a Manifest, [manifest one](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/sharing-github-apps/registering-a-github-app-from-a-manifest).
* [ ] Consider releasing a [release plan](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
* [ ] CI/CD:
    * [ ] Create GitHub Actions [for your repo](https://github.com/features/actions).
        * Other tools like [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) and [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops) are available.    
    * [ ] Create [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), if you'd like.
        * I recommend [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
        * [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is also available.   
* [ ] Containerize the code.
    * Add, for example, a Dockerfile or compose.yaml, if using Docker.   
* [ ] This is a parent checkbox for all Python-specific items:
  * [ ] Populate requirements.txt and keep it populated through pip freeze > requirements.txt
  * [ ] Confirm tests are in /tests
  * [ ] Confirm source code is in /source
  * [ ] Confirm docs are in /docs
  * [ ] Create Setup.py
